# Word-Auto-Completion
Word auto-completion algorithm that combines (1) a dictionary maker and, (2) trie data structure to form words.

The first part of the algorithm is used to read in a list of words and return the dictionary and word frequency count of each unique
word. The second part it used to define a trie data structure used for storing a suffix tree. The final part of the algorithm is then used to take these 2 algorithms to form a complete word auto completion system using the dictionary and data structure.
